# Modified Quarto

Quarto is a board game for two players invented by Swiss mathematician Blaise Müller in 1991.  It is played on a 4×4 board.There are 16 unique pieces, players take turns choosing a piece which the other player must then place on the board. A player wins by placing a piece on the board which forms a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row of four pieces, all of which have a common attribute.

In my version of this game, I have changed the tokens used for the game pieces, but all else remains the same.
